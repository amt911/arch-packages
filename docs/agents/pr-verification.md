# Agentic PR verification

## Agentic PR verification (MANDATORY on every PR)

> **Project engine:** packaging/build/install/signature smoke in a disposable Arch environment
> replaces the web/mobile engines below. Inspect metadata, public-key/database signatures,
> published paths and pacman behavior; deterministic checks remain authoritative and exploratory
> findings advisory. No root `scripts/verify/verify-pr.sh` or MCP verification config exists yet.
> Preserve the report/manual-test-plan requirements, but do not claim a pass without running it.
> Posting comments requires the authorization of the active session/platform; this guide-writing
> task authorizes no external message. The handoff's never-push/never-merge rule still applies.

**Every PR MUST be verified end-to-end before merge, and the verdict MUST be posted as a PR comment**
(`gh pr comment`). Running the pass and posting the verdict is **not optional**. Once a PR exists, a
headless agent **drives the running app end-to-end** and posts the verdict, then **waits for you to
close/merge**. Its job is to catch what diffs and unit tests miss: missing buttons, unimplemented
content, dead flows, screens that don't match the spec. The verdict is informational for gating (it
never merges anything) — but producing it on every PR is required.

- **Local & headless.** Runs on your machine via `claude -p` (headless/print mode), posts with
  `gh pr comment`. No CI minutes, no repo secrets. Fits an unattended loop.
- **Two surfaces, two engines** (one orchestrator picks by which paths the PR touched):
  - **Web** → **Playwright MCP** (headless Chromium) against `localhost`.
  - **Native mobile (Compose / SwiftUI)** → **`maestro mcp`** — Maestro's own MCP server, which
    exposes the same device and automation commands the committed flows use, so whatever the agent
    discovers can be written straight back as a `.maestro/` flow. It navigates the native
    **accessibility tree** over `adb` rather than screenshot coordinates. Run it against an
    **emulator or a dedicated test device**, and pair it with `maestro hierarchy` to see what is
    actually reachable. Alternatives if it is unavailable: **mobile-mcp**, or **appium-mcp**
    (UiAutomator2 / XCUITest drivers). iOS analog via the XCUITest driver.
  - **Any other runnable surface** generalizes the same way — Playwright covers any web app;
    Python / API smoke via `pytest` + `httpx`.
- **Reliability key = semantics.** Agentic navigation is only as reliable as the accessibility layer:
  good ARIA roles on web, `Modifier.testTag(...)` / `contentDescription` / `Modifier.semantics { }` on
  Compose. Without labels the agent falls back to fragile screenshot coordinates. **Audit that the
  flows you verify are labeled** before relying on this.
- **Two layers.** Deterministic tests (Playwright specs on web, Maestro flows + Espresso/Compose on
  mobile) are the
  **hard merge gate** — they already ran and passed pre-push, so the PR arrives with its flows
  proven. The agentic pass is **advisory**: it explores the new surface, **writes the regression
  specs that are missing** (a flow the agent had to discover by hand is a flow with no spec — that's
  a finding, report it), and leaves a readable verdict. Because the agent is
  non-deterministic, it **never vetoes a merge on its own** — its value is coverage and a legible
  report, not gatekeeping.
- **The verdict reads structure too.** Besides the packaging/build/install/signature smoke, it names
  what the diff does to the
  [Design principles](design-principles.md#design-principles--solid-applied-with-judgement) — a new violation (a script
  that stopped isolating its side effects, a growing `case`/`if` chain) or a new speculative
  abstraction. Findings, not a veto — like the rest of the pass.
- **Cases come from the spec.** Draw the scenarios from the spec's `## Cases` / `## Casuísticas` block;
  tag them `[web]` / `[mobile]` when one spec covers both surfaces.
- **Trigger.** It's the **last step of the superpowers pipeline, right after a PR exists**:
  - **"modo desatendido"** — the agent pushes the branch, opens the PR, and fires verification itself.
  - **"normal mode"** — you open the PR; the agent then runs the local `verify-pr.sh` and posts the
    verdict (**mandatory before merge**, not merely on request — running the script + `gh pr comment`
    needs no push, so this respects the never-push default). Runnable by hand anytime.
- **Hard limits** (these do not relax in any mode): the verdict **awaits your close** and the agent
  **never merges** — see **Git & GitHub**. Point it at a **dedicated emulator / test device, never your
  daily phone**. Scope `--allowedTools` to exactly what the run needs; `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  only in a controlled local env, never as a habit. Confirm flag names with `claude -p --help`.
