# Agent orchestration

## Agent orchestration — parallel where it's free, batched where it's yours

> **Project override:** one subagent total, including reviews; no parallel-review exception here.
> Preserve the scheduling rationale below as template context, but perform implementation and
> review sequentially. Exclusive resources are the writable package checkout, build output
> (`public/` or `.build-out/`), build container pacman database, and signing keyring; only one
> writer owns each. The FontForge build also shares the machine's mandatory memory budget.
> Root `docs/FACTS.md` is not created yet. Use the ledger/handoff now; if created in later work,
> every fact records verification method and date, never plans or assumed measurements.

Delegating work to agents moves the bottleneck from typing to **scheduling**: what waits on what,
what each agent has to rediscover, and which decisions quietly stop being yours. Same convention as
[Debugging](debugging.md#debugging--keep-the-loop-from-running-away) — every rule carries the number it came
from, out of the same measured 15 h session.

- **Review is not on the critical path.** Reviewing task N and starting task N+1 are independent
  whenever they touch different files. Serialized, review is **10-15% of the wall clock** and blocks
  everything queued behind it; run in parallel it costs nothing at all. **On receiving an
  implementation report, dispatch its review and the next implementation in the same turn.**
  This is the one sanctioned exception to *"at most 1 agent at a time"* in
  [normal mode](../../AGENTS.md#mode-switch): the cap is one **implementation** agent. A review agent reads and
  reports — it writes nothing, so it cannot race the implementer.
  Project values: one subagent total; exclusive resources and sequential review are specified above.
- **Keep one shared facts file.** Every fresh agent rediscovers the same things: the real selector,
  which fake already exists, what that helper actually accepts. Keep `docs/FACTS.md` in the
  workspace, have each agent append to it when it finishes, and hand it to the next one in its
  dispatch. What belongs there: **facts verified against the repo or the device**, never opinions or
  plans. It is not `docs/FINDINGS.md` and does not replace it — FINDINGS holds the durable gotcha
  that is *not* deducible from the code, FACTS holds what is perfectly deducible and merely
  expensive to rediscover, and FACTS is allowed to go stale and die with the branch.
- **Plans carry contracts, not literal code.** The agent **trusts** the code you put in the plan; if
  you never compiled it, you have written an error wearing authority. **Measured: 4 wrong code
  blocks, 15-40 min of detour each.** Write exact names, exact signatures, and "mirror the shape of
  `the existing implementation`" — claims the agent can verify against the repo — and reserve literal code for what you have
  actually run. This is what `writing-plans` produces; keep it that way when you edit the plan by
  hand.
- **Batch the discretionary decisions.** The work that shows up along the way — a capability being
  quietly dropped, a missing script, an adjacent bug — added up to **5-6 h of 15**. Every one was
  justified on its own; deciding them as they appear is what takes them away from you. Accumulate
  them and ask **once per batch, with the estimated cost of each**. In **"modo desatendido"** there
  is nobody to ask, so the batch goes into the PR body as a list with its costs — the decision is
  still yours, it just moves to review time.
- **What never gets cut.** With the numbers on the table: review was **1.5 h of 15**, and it found a
  `create()` silently discarding fields, a 404 caused by SQL deduplication, a silent merge that
  corrupted data, a delete-and-recreate with no transaction, and several inert assertions. **Cutting
  review does not give time back; it defers it to production.** If something has to be cut, cut
  reproduction (write the shortcut — see
  [Budget the lap](debugging.md#the-loop-is-the-cost)) and cut serialization (dispatch the review in parallel).
  Never verification.

### Day one — the numbers that fill the blanks

Three measurements, taken once at the start of a project, turn every `project-specific value` above into something
enforceable. None of them takes more than an afternoon.

1. **The lap** — time `build → deploy → reach the state → observe` once, on a real bug if there is
   one, and write the seconds into the table in
   [The loop is the cost](debugging.md#the-loop-is-the-cost). Whichever phase dominates is the one that gets a
   shortcut script; the rest are noise and stay unoptimized.
2. **The exclusive resource** — name the thing only one agent can hold at a time (emulator, dev
   database, dev-server port, a physical device) and write it into the orchestration note above.
   Everything else parallelizes; this is the one that corrupts a run when two agents touch it.
3. **The inert assertions** — break one assertion on purpose and run the suite. Anything still green
   is inert. Then walk the table in [Tests that cannot fail](debugging.md#tests-that-cannot-fail), delete the
   rows this stack cannot produce, and name the mechanism for the ones it can.

Record all three in this file, not in a session — the point is that the next session inherits them.
